# NPD Activation in the City of Sydney Area

## 1. Introduction:

Launching a new product in a competitive market requires marketers to think creative, identifying opportunities that will drive brand engagement and new product knowledge and as a result set the product apart of its competition. 

In this project we have a ficticious beverage company that wants to launch their new sugar-free spirit, with a brand that is confident, fearless and fun with a memorable experience. The product is ready to hit the market, and they are targeting an audience formed by younger professionals, looking for an alternative/better for you alcohol drink, and that are keen in trying new and trendy things.

The company has engaged a brand agency to suggest and negotiate on their behalf space on key venues in the City of Sydney Area for the set up of "Summer Pop-Up Bars". The engaged agency will use one of it's data scientists and his/her knowledge of Foursquare, a location based application, to recommend venues to the client, through the exploration of the area where the activation will happen. 

### 1.1 Audiences:

<ul>

<li> Consummers that will be the receives of a campaign.</li>
